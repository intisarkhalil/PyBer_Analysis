# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this project is to perform an exploratory analysis on **PyBer** ride-sharing data during 2019 [Resources](https://github.com/intisarkhalil/PyBer_Analysis.git), to create several types of visualizations and insights show the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers, rides as well as percentage of total fares, rides, and drivers by type of the city. The specific purpose of this report it to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. In this analysis we write a **Python’s** scripts using **Panda’s** libraries, **Jupyter Notebook**, and **Matplotlib**. 

## Results: 
The following image show that rural cities had the highest average fare per driver ($55.49) and ride ($34.62), while urban cities had the lowest average fare per driver ($16.57) and ride ($24.53).

The following multiple line graph show the trend analysis of fare by city type, per week. Urban cities had the highest total fare in general compare with rural and suburban cities. Rural cities had the lowest total fare per week while suburban cities based in the medial between urban and rural cites.

There is an increasing in the total fare in the last week of February in all city types. 

## Summary: 
The analysis and visualizations provide in this project will help **PyBer** to improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.  Based on the results, there are three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
-	Analysis on the size of the population and the population component by age and employment in each city, will clarify the differences between cities.
-	Providing an analysis of the average daily working time (morning, day, and evening) which will also show further differences in cities.
-	A descriptive analysis of the distance for each trip may give another dimension to the analysis and further explain the differences between cities.
